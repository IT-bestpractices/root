      "long_description": "Requiring a minimum password length makes password cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive behavior that may result.\n\nWhile it does not negate the password length requirement, it is preferable to migrate from a password-based authentication scheme to a stronger one based on PKI (public key infrastructure).",
