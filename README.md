This is the repository for the IT best practices open source project.
Our project collects information about a variety of 
mechanically-verifiable IT best practices, with our initial emphasis being on security.

This effort is in support of _"best practices as code"_ efforts, even though it's
not currently our intent to provide this code as part of this project.

Verifying that a particular practice is followed is typically as simple as checking
to see that a particular feature is turned off or on, or that some value matches
some regular expression.
However _explaining_ these best practices is much more difficult and time-consuming.
It is our intent primarily to collect and curate these bodies of text and leave the
implementation of the checks to the various tools involved.

This allows us to share the difficult work of explaining these practices,
and avoids arguing about the best method for implementing these checks in
a particular environment might be.

We expect to collect as much as possible from other public sources. In particular,
the NIST STIGs, and the SecComFrame, and Lynis projects seem to be good potential sources.

The basic idea here is to collect and cross-reference all these sources in one
freely-available repository.
